Title: landscape obtaining and optimization machine
Description: Standardised geo-operators for an evidence based approach to generate and modify spatial patterns. This is centred around punch card-like algorithms that make pipelines of spatial operations transparent and reproducible, just like Jacquard looms made the production of fabric with patterns available at industrial scale.
