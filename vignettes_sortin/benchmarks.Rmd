# Introduction

This script compares carries out benchmarks for diferent functions.

```{r}
# packages for testing
# library(bench)
# library(testthat)
# library(checkmate)
# library(lomm)
```

## Objects to test

First I create a couple of objects that will be tested.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# largeRaster <- raster::getData("worldclim", var = "tmin", res = 10)$tmin1
# smallRaster <- gtRasters$categorical
# 
# largeGridGeom <- gc_geom(input = largeRaster)
# smallGridGeom <- gtGeoms$grid$categorical
```

The objects have the following sizes

```{r}
# getSize <- function(x){
#   temp <- object.size(x)
#   print(temp, units = "KB")
# }
# 
# getSize(x = largeRaster)
# getSize(x = largeGridGeom)
# 
# getSize(x = smallRaster)
# getSize(x = smallGridGeom)
```

`largeGridGeom` is the largest file, as it is recently loaded into memory entirely.
However, `smallGridGeom` is smaller than `smallRaster`, so probably `largeGridGeom` is also smaller than `largeRaster`, once that is loaded into memory for plotting.
